# This document contains important information relating to dev work

- This code uses ES6 and newer JavaScript syntax.

- Code uses 2 spaces for indentation. No tabs allowed (yes, it takes up
  bytes, but dev files taking up space is irrelevant; it gets minified
  away, and as dev purposes you want clarity, not conciseness).

- Incompletions in the code are marked with FIXME: and TODO:, usually both.
